# LiberatePDF2 Kotlin client library

The README.md and the code itself is generated by `openapi-generator`, so read this one first.

## Incompatibilities to a Gradle multi-project

Most files are generated by `openapi-generator`. Unfortunately, the used Gradle version is quite old which does not play
well with an up-to-date Gradle multi-project. Therefore, there are some files *not* generated (defined
by `.openapi-generator-ignore`) but manually written. This leads to the problem, that necessary changes to that files (
i.e. changed dependencies, or the like) will not be put into these files automatically. So these files might be checked
occasionally whether they need some changes. (TODO: another idea might be to create a git branch which is fully
generated and to merge changes into the main branch).
